You can find temperature under `Maximum temperature (Degree C)` column which represents maximum temperature for the day. Under the `data` directory, you get `weather_data_2018.csv` and `weather_data_2019.csv` files from where you can read daily temperatures. In order to get temperature for a day so that you can use in your combined dataframe (joining Strava and Cheetah datasets), you need to make `date` column consistent in both dataframes. \n",
